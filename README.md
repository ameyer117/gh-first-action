# Getting Started with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation and CI/CD platform that helps you automate your software development workflows. This guide will help you understand the basics and get started with your first workflow.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions allow you to create custom workflows that can be triggered by various GitHub events (like push, pull request, issue creation, etc.). These workflows are defined in YAML files and stored in your repository under `.github/workflows/`.

## Key Concepts

- **Workflow**: An automated process made up of one or more jobs
- **Event**: A specific activity that triggers a workflow
- **Job**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner
- **Step**: An individual task that can run commands or actions
- **Action**: A custom application that performs a complex but frequently repeated task
- **Runner**: A server that runs your workflows

## Example Workflow

Here's a simple example of a workflow that runs tests whenever code is pushed to the repository:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

## Common Use Cases

1. **Continuous Integration**: Automatically build and test your code
2. **Automated Testing**: Run your test suite on multiple environments
3. **Package Publishing**: Automatically publish packages to registries
4. **Deployment**: Deploy your application to various environments
5. **Code Quality**: Run linters and security scanners

## Benefits

- üîÑ Automated workflows save time and reduce manual errors
- üåç Run on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- üîß Extensive marketplace of pre-built actions
- üîó Easy integration with other GitHub features
- üí∞ Free for public repositories

## Getting Started

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository
2. Add a YAML file (e.g., `ci.yml`) in the workflows directory
3. Define your workflow using the GitHub Actions syntax
4. Commit and push your changes
5. Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository

## Best Practices

- Keep workflows focused and simple
- Use repository secrets for sensitive data
- Cache dependencies to speed up workflows
- Use specific versions of actions instead of `@master`
- Add status badges to your README
